what is jsx ? why is such a big deal in react ? 

compoent contains : 
    data
    logic 
    apperence 

jsx need to describe what component needs to look like , based on the data and logic (for compoent appearence)
ro render the component on UI 

JSX is extension of javascript, to combine html,css,javascript into 1 line code 

how react understand html code, 
    jsx convert the html to js codde (babel conversion)

so without jsx  
    we need to create html elements manuaglly uisng js 
        React.createElement('header) ... 
    and thats needs a lot of time and effort 

jsx is declarative : 
    imperative ? 
        when building ui using native js 
        manual select elements
        confguring using dom 
        until reach the desired approach 
    
    declarative : 
        describe the ui should like all times , based on curren data inside the component 
        based on props and states 
        all of that happnen without dom operations 
        is a huge abstraction away from the dom

    in declarative approach : use react (jsx) 
    in imeprative : using native js
