this is rest operator : 
    const [primaryGenre, seconderyGenre, ...otherGenres] = genres;

the "..." is also used for spread operator (both in arrays and objects) 
    const newGenres = [...genres, "epic fantasy"]; // take all the values of genres, and place it one by one to make newGenres 1 level of elements (no nasted arrays )

    instead of this  const newGenres = [genres, "epic fantasy"];: 
        [
            [
                'science fiction', 'humor', 'speculative fiction', 'short stories', 'fantasy'
            ],
            'epic fantasy'
        ]

    it should be like this : const newGenres = [...genres, "epic fantasy"];
        Array(6) [
        'science fiction', 'humor', 'speculative fiction', 'short stories', 'fantasy',
        'epic fantasy'
        ]
