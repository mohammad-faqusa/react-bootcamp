as you can see this undefined error : 

function getTotalReviewCount(book) {
  const goodread = book.reviews.goodreads.reviewsCount;
  const librarything = book.reviews.librarything.reviewsCount; //Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reviewsCount')
    const librarything = book.reviews?.librarything?.reviewsCount; //NaN --optional chaining is used---
  return goodread + librarything;
}

console.log(getTotalReviewCount(books[2])); // NaN, if '?' is used 
//without optional chaining '?'  :  Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'reviewsCount')
