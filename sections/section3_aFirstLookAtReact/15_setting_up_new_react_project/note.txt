the two options for setting up react project : 
    create-react-app
        starter kit
        every things is already configured : ESLins, Prettier, Jest etc.

        but slow and oudated 

        so don't use it for real world application, 
        but still useful for course, tutorials, and anything with small projects  

    vite 
        build real world application , as we will do at the end of the course 

        is quite different one 

        use for modern real-world apps 

        but need manually setupt ESLint (and otherss) 

        why even use Vite, in first place : 
            exteremly fast automatically refresh page (hot module replacement)
            bundling is extermely fast 

            it updates when code is changed 


what about react frameworkd ? 
    next js 
    remix 

    containns solutions of routing, data fetching, server side rendering , etc. (things React does not provice easily )


    vanilla react apps ? 
        still have very important place too, even without using frameworks 

âœŒ don't worry about recommendation for now !
