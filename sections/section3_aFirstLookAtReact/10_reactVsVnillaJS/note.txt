following the link in sadbox to see the difference : 
https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-first-app-advice-52879f?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js%3A1%2C1-34%2C1



differences :
    in react, every thing is written in js 
    while in vanilla js, html still in charge 


    in vanilla js, manual select the dom elements 
    while react, there is no manual declaration and class to elements 

    event listener : 
        defing seperate function in vanilla js 
        while in react is simpler, just add on the same line "onClick={}" 

    in vanilla js, we need to define global variables to make UI in sync with declaration 
    while in react, we define in easier way (state)
