why do front-end frameworks exists ? 


before around 2010: 
    the server side rendering 
    so the pages based on data and templates from server


how ever developers stated writing more and more js code , until at some point ...
    these bacame fully fleshed applications :
        which tell us to move to single page application: 
        rendering the web page on clinet side 
        
        so we don't need to call it web pages , but web applications 

        
  
you can cick buttons, submit, whitout page reloading ! 


comparason building with vanilla js, react
    task of single page app : 
    to keep the UI is sync with the data
    it is really hard problem to solve with vanilla js 

    for example if we update time/date, it should be updated for each component in page, and this is dounting process for vanilla js 

    

problem with vanilla : 
    dom manipulation and traversing, however state is usuallly soted in the DOM, shared accross entire app 

to summarize : 
    keeping UI sync with data is hard, so front end frameworks takes this hardword away from developers 
    enforce a correct way in writing and strcturing the code (a lot less than spegity code)
